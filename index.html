            <p><b>
                I am Hasan Rabit.I am a web designer & devloper. I haven't done anything for anyone yet. But my goal is to satisfy my clients with my coding skills. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well. I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools I’d prefer to be using.</b></p>
